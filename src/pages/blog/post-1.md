### Call Home Christmas Campaign Bridges Connectivity Gap For Migrant Workers

Call Home is all about connectivity — for good! Support their Christmas campaign 2020 so migrant workers can call their loved ones back home during this holiday season.

> Started by 4 strangers who met through better.sg, a local organization that helps volunteer groups like ourselves to build tech products for social good, Call Home is on mission to improve connectivity for the migrant workers population in Singapore.
