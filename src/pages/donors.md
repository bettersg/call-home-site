    title: Imagine not being able to talk to the people you love
    content: Covid-19 has been an isolating and anxious time for migrant workers in
      Singapore. Speaking with their families is one of their main comforts.
      Sadly, migrant workers in Singapore face significant challenges in calling
      their loved ones for support.

        title: Why aren’t they able to call home now?
        content: >-
          Many of our migrant workers’ families do not have stable internet
          access. To contact their families, workers rely on expensive
          international calling cards, which can cost $30-40 a month, or up to
          10% of their take-home pay. The high cost of calls results in workers
          limiting the amount of time they speak to their families for.\

          \

          COVID restrictions mean many cannot return to work or leave their dorms. Salary cuts make these cards too expensive, while movement restrictions make purchasing physical cards impossible.

        content: Migrant workers are here in Singapore to support their families. Call
          Home enables them to call their families back home easily and
          virtually for free. Often, that one call is all they need to keep
          going for another day.

        content: 98.5% of the proceeds will go directly to the worker's talktime, making
          it free for workers. We have also negotiated a discounted rate so that
          donating to Call Home is 40-55% cheaper than standard calling rates,
          making your donation stretch even further.

          “Call Home helped me a lot to connect with my family. Even though my
          family doesn’t use internet, we can talk very easily using the Call
          Home app; we can continue talking for more than half an hour. It’s
          really great for us.”\

          কল হোম আমাকে পরিবারের সাথে যোগাযোগ করতে অনেক সহায়তা করেছে। যদিও আমার পরিবার ইন্টারনেট ব্যবহার করে না, আমরা অ্যাপ্লিকেশনটি ব্যবহার করে খুব সহজেই কথা বলতে পারি এবং আমরা আধ ঘন্টারও বেশি সময় ধরে কথা বলতে পারি can এটি আমাদের জন্য সত্যই দুর্দান্ত
