        title: How does Call Home work? How much do migrant workers save?
        content: Call Home is powered by Twilio, which allows 3G to landline calls. Our
          overall calling costs are up to 30% lower than standard calling rates.

        title: Which countries does Call Home support?
        content: Currently, we support migrant workers with a valid Singapore number.
          Bangladesh, where the majority of our migrant workers’ families
          reside, is currently the only country which calls can be made to. We
          are looking to support more countries if demand increases.

        title: What will the funds be used for?
        content: 98.5% of donations will go to fund the calling costs for migrant
          workers. The remaining 1.5% goes to Give.asia, for development costs
          to keep Call Home running.

        title: How will Call Home sustain itself for the long-term?
        content: Call Home started as a passion project between four friends who wanted
          to do something for our migrant worker brothers during the COVID-19
          period. We hope to build a community of recurring givers who will
          continue to support our migrant workers on Call Home. Give.asia will
          also provide development support to maintain the service and build new
          features to help migrant workers stay connected to their loved ones
          back home.

        title: Why donate to Call Home? Why not sponsor calling cards directly?
        content: >-
          Many workers’ families do not have access to wifi and cannot afford
          data plans that make WhatsApp or Viber calls possible. Workers often
          spend $30-40 each month on IDD cards alone, not including data plans
          they purchase to access other services.


          COVID-19 restrictions mean many migrant workers have yet to return to work. Unable to earn any income, purchasing IDD cards become a luxury they cannot afford. For those that have returned to work, tight movement restrictions mean going out to purchase IDD cards from stores is a significant challenge.


          The result: migrant workers cannot reach their families just when they need them the most. Call Home aims to fill that gap.
