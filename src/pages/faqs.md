        title: Why donate to Call Home? Why not sponsor calling cards directly?
        content: >-
          Existing solutions do not work well for every migrant worker. For many
          workers, their families back home do not have stable internet access
          or cannot afford data plans that make WhatsApp or Viber calls
          possible. Workers often spend $30-40 each month on calling cards
          alone, not including data plans they purchase to access other
          services. The high cost of calls forces them to limit the amount of
          time they speak to their loved ones for.\

          \

          Due to the COVID-19 situation, many migrant workers have yet to return to work, and are not receiving any income. Purchasing calling cards becomes a luxury they cannot afford. For the lucky few that have returned to work, going out to purchase calling cards from stores are out of the question, due to tight movement restrictions. As a result, in times where migrant workers need to lean on their closest family the most, they aren't able to do so. Call Home aims to fill that gap.

        title: How does Call Home work? How much do migrant workers save?
        content: Call Home is powered by Twilio, which allows 3G to landline calls.
          We’ve negotiated a discounted rate from Twilio, which means that the
          overall calling costs are up to 30% lower than traditional IDD calls.

        title: Which countries does Call Home support?
        content: Currently, we support migrant workers with a valid Singapore number.
          Bangladesh, where the majority of our migrant workers’ families
          reside, is currently the only country which calls can be made to. We
          are looking to support more countries if demand increases.

        title: What will the funds be used for?
        content: 98.5% of donations will go to fund the calling costs for migrant
          workers. The remaining 1.5% goes to Give.asia, for development costs
          to keep Call Home running.

        title: How will Call Home sustain itself for the long-term?
        content: Call Home started as a passion project between four friends who wanted
          to do something for our migrant worker brothers during the COVID-19
          period. We hope to build a community of recurring givers who will
          continue to support our migrant workers on Call Home. Give.asia will
          also provide development support to maintain the service and build new
          features to help migrant workers stay connected to their loved ones
          back home.
